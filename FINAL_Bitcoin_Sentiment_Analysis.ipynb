        "#Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "## Abstract\n",
        "This independent study investigates the predictive power of online sentiment on Bitcoin price movements using machine learning and time-series forecasting models. Sentiment scores were extracted from Reddit, Twitter (Kaggle dataset), and news headlines (GNews), and were combined with Google Trends data and historical Bitcoin prices (from Yahoo Finance). Sentiment was analyzed using VADER. An ARIMA model with walk-forward backtesting was employed for baseline prediction, while an LSTM model was trained using a multivariate feature set. The results show that sentiment-derived features improve forecasting accuracy, suggesting that social media and online trends significantly influence cryptocurrency markets.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.Overview\n",
        "Bitcoin (BTC) is characterized by extreme volatility and speculative behavior, with its price often influenced by factors beyond traditional economic indicators. With the growth of social platforms like Reddit and Twitter, investor sentiment spreads rapidly, influencing crypto market dynamics. This study evaluates the extent to which sentiment data can enhance Bitcoin price predictions when incorporated into machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Hypothesis\n",
        "> Sentiment data from social media and online sources, combined with search interest metrics, can improve the accuracy of Bitcoin price prediction models compared to models relying solely on historical price data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Data Collection and Sources\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Twitter Data**: Historical tweet dataset from **Kaggle**, filtered by Bitcoin-related keywords (e.g., “Bitcoin”, “BTC”).\n",
        "- **Reddit Data**: Posts and comments from subreddits like r/Bitcoin and r/CryptoCurrency, collected using **Pushshift API**.\n",
        "- **News Data**: Headlines and snippets sourced from the **GNews API**, focused on Bitcoin-related articles.\n",
        "- **Google Trends**: Interest-over-time data for the search term “Bitcoin”, retrieved via Pytrends.\n",
        "- **Bitcoin Price**: Historical price data (open, high, low, close, volume) obtained from **Yahoo Finance**.\n",
        "\n",

        "## 4. Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.1 Sentiment Analysis\n",
        "- Sentiment scores were calculated using the **VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer**, chosen for its performance on social media and short text.\n",
        "- Each source was processed to compute daily average sentiment scores.\n",
        "- Rolling averages were used to smooth fluctuations and better capture trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.2 Feature Engineering\n",
        "- Final model features:\n",
        "  - `price`\n",
        "  - `google_trend_rolling`\n",
        "  - `news_sentiment_rolling`\n",
        "  - `reddit_sentiment_rolling`\n",
        "  - `twitter_sentiment_rolling`\n",
        "- Sentiment features used 3- to 7-day rolling means.\n",
        "- All features normalized and aligned to daily granularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.3 Modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ARIMA\n",
        "- Baseline forecasting using ARIMA.\n",
        "- **Walk-forward backtesting** was applied to simulate real-world forecasting conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### LSTM\n",
        "- Multivariate LSTM model trained on the engineered features.\n",
        "- The LSTM architecture included input timesteps, dropout for regularization, and mean squared error (MSE) loss.\n",
        "- Evaluated using test-train split and RMSE.\n",

        "- **Twitter Data**: Dataset sourced from Kaggle may not be up to date or fully representative due to lack of real-time access.\n",
        "- **Noise and Sarcasm**: VADER, while effective for general sentiment, may misclassify sarcastic or context-specific content.\n",
        "- **Temporal Resolution**: Sentiment data aggregated daily may overlook intraday dynamics.\n",
        "- **Generalization**: LSTM performance may degrade on unseen market events or changes in user behavior.\n",

        "\n",
        "Google Trends is the most strongly correlated with Bitcoin price (+0.43) 🚀\n",
        "→ More public attention = more price activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reddit sentiment shows slight positive relationship with price 🧠\n",
        "→ Reddit discussions mirror some price movements but are noisy.\n",
        "\n",
        "News sentiment is very weakly correlated 📢\n",
        "→ News reacts emotionally but inconsistently to Bitcoin price movements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Twitter sentiment shows surprising negative correlation 😮\n",
        "→ Likely because Twitter remained positive even during the May crash (delayed emotional reaction).\n",
        "\n",
        "**🎯 Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Google Trends appears to be the most useful early indicator among all.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment scores alone (especially from news and Twitter) cannot reliably predict price unless combined with other signals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Combining price action, Google Trends, and sentiment shifts could improve forecasting models.\n",
        "\n",
        "**✅ Overall:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The heatmap reveals that public attention (Google search interest) is more closely aligned with Bitcoin’s price movements than raw sentiment scores from News, Reddit, or Twitter.\n",
